So server screen blanks

Try adding consoleblank=60 or any mount of seconds that you want to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= line in the /etc/default/grub file. Then run sudo update-grub and reboot the system.

After your choice of seconds added to consoleblank the monitor should turn off after booting the system up.
